# HaddopMapReduce
A large distributed directed graph dataset is combined and converted to undirected graph dataset. Then, complete information about their connectivity to other nodes (in terms of maximum and minimum) and their neighborhood like adjacency list are computed to find a shortest and efficient path from any start node to any end node in both directed and undirected graph.
